1. **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and querying from the company's database.
2. **Power BI**: For creating interactive and insightful visualizations to present the findings.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Regional Performance**: Identified top-performing regions and areas needing improvement.
2. **Product Analysis**: Determined best-selling products and those with declining sales.
3. **Trend Analysis**: Uncovered seasonal sales trends and patterns over time.
